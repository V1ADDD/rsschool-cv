            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I’m a frontend developer with a love for Angular. I’m passionate about crafting responsive, intuitive, and downright delightful web applications that not only work smoothly but also feel like second nature to users. Think of me as someone who takes design mockups and turns them into reality — without breaking a sweat (or at least, not too much). While my main expertise lies in Angular, building modular, scalable, and high-performance applications, I also dabble in backend development. It’s like dessert—nice to have but not the main course. With a little help from Django REST, I can whip up a solid API or smooth data flow to keep everything running harmoniously.</p>
